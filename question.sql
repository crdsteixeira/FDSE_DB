--a)  Who run the fastest 10K race ever (name, birthdate, time)?
SELECT runner.runner_name, runner.birthdate, participation_details.official_time

	  official_time IN (SELECT min(official_time) 
			FROM participation_details)



--b)  What 10K race had the fastest average time (event, event date)?
SELECT event_type.eventtype_name AS event_name, event.event_year, AVG(participation_details.official_time)

--c)  What teams had more than 3 participants in the 2016 maratona  (team)?
SELECT team.team_name, COUNT(participation_details.team_id)

GROUP BY team.team_name
HAVING COUNT(team.team_id) > 3



--d)  What are the 5 runners with more kilometers in total (name, birthdate, kms)?
--------
--- quando a BD tiver completa ver se vale a pena fazer por evento mais recent dos que tem mais totais 
--- ou fazer questÃ£o extra para isto
--------
SELECT runner.runner_name, runner.birthdate, SUM(event.distance) AS kms
FROM runner JOIN 
	 participation_details USING(runner_id) JOIN
